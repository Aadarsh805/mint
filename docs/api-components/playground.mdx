## Introduction

The API playground is an interactive environment to make requests and preview an API endpoint.

To create an API page, you must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata. See [Configuration](api-components/configuration) for more details.

###

## Hiding API playgrounds

You can disable API playgrounds site-wide by setting `hidePlayground` in your `mint.json` file. You usually only want to disable the API playground if you have an OpenApi file and want to show the parameters without an interactive playground.

```json mint.json
"api": {
    "hidePlayground": true
}
```
