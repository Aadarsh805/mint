## API Playground

### Introduction

The API playground lets you create an interactive environment to make requests and preview your API endpoints.

See our [analytics](/analytics/posthog) endpoint for a real use case of the API playground in action.

## Setting the API metadata

In order to configure a page for the API playground, the `api` field in the metadata must be configured using the following format

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: 'Create new user'
> api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
---
```

```md Format
---
title: '...'
> api: [method] [endpoint]
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### Method

Can be any one of the following REST API methods

| Method   | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | Retrieve information about the REST API resource |
| `POST`   | Create a REST API resource                       |
| `PUT`    | Update a REST API resource                       |
| `PATCH`  | Update a REST API resource                       |
| `DELETE` | Delete a REST API resource or related component  |

### Endpoint

The endpoint should point to the API that the playground should call. For example, it can be something like

```bash
https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint
```

<Note>

If you have `apiBase` configured in the [configuration file](/configuration), you can use relative paths (example: `/v1/endpoint`)

</Note>

## OpenAPI

Mintlify also supports OpenAPI/Swagger files. Learn more at the [OpenAPI guide](/api-components/openapi).
