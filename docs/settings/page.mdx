## Page

### Metadata

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
---
title: [title of the page]
description: [description]
---
```

```md Example
---
title: "Page"
description: "Set the title, description, and mode of each page"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>

Both `title` and `description` are optional.

If `title` is empty, the name of the file is used instead. If `description` is empty, no description will be displayed. However, we recommend adding a description for better SEO!

</Note>

<Note>

The `sidebarTitle` attribute can also be used to override the name of the sidebar navigation button when it exists.

</Note>

### API metadata

API pages lets you build an interactive API playground. To create an API page, you must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata.

<CodeGroup>

```md API
---
api or openapi: [method] [endpoint]
---
```

```md API Example
---
api or openapi: "GET /users"
---
```

</CodeGroup>
