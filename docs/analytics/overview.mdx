We send custom documentation events in addition to the ones built-in to SDKs. For example, we send an event when a user opens or closes an [Accordion](../components/accordion).

You can set your analytics keys in `mint.config.json` or by making a PUT requests to our various endpoints.

The syntax for `mint.config.json` is below:

```json mint.config.json
"analytics": {
    "amplitude": {
        "apiKey": "required"
    },
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "required",
        "apiHost": "optional"
    },
    "mixpanel": {
        "projectToken": "required"
    },
    "hotjar": {
        "hjid": "required",
        "hjsv": "required"
    }
}
```

You only need to include entries for the analytics you want to integrate.
