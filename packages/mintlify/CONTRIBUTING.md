# Running CLI Locally

Note - contributing requires `yarn` and it's recommended you install it as a global installation. If you don't have yarn installed already run `npm install --global yarn` in your terminal.

Run `npm run local` to build and install the CLI locally.

You need to run the command after every change you want to test.
